            <Title>15. Nondiscrimination Policy.</Title>
            <Text>
                We want all Users to feel welcome and included on our Sites, applications, and tools (the “Properties”).
                Accordingly, we prohibit discrimination against Users, guests, or Our Representatives based on race,
                color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, disability, marital, family, pregnancy status, sexual
                orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran or citizenship status, age, or any other
                characteristic protected under applicable federal, regional, state, or local law. Such discrimination
                includes, but is not limited to, refusing to provide or accept services or any other conduct that
                improperly takes into account these characteristics. This prohibition applies to the posting of
                discriminatory content, such as reviews or forum posts, on our Properties. We will, at our discretion,
                take steps to enforce this policy, up to and including suspending from our Properties those Vendors and
                Members who violate this policy. If you experience discrimination with any Member or Vendor, please
                contact support at help@lovestoriestv.com, with the subject “Nondiscrimination Policy”, so we can
                investigate and take appropriate measures.

            <Text>
                <Bold>a. Entire Agreement and Severability. </Bold> Terms of Service are the entire agreement
                between you and us with respect to the Services, including use of the Site, and supersede all prior or
                contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and us
                with respect to the Services. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found to be unenforceable or
                invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these
                Terms of Service will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of either
                party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any
                further rights hereunder
            </Text>
            <Text>
                <Bold>b. Force Majeure. </Bold> shall not be liable for any failure to perform our obligations
                hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control, including, without
                limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                <Bold>c. Assignment. </Bold> Terms of Service are personal to you, and are not assignable,
                transferable or sublicensable by you except with our prior written consent. We may assign, transfer or
                delegate any of our rights and obligations hereunder without consent.
            </Text>
            <Text>

                <Bold>f. No Waiver. </Bold> failure to enforce any part of these Terms of Service shall not
                constitute a waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of these Terms of Service.
                Waiver of compliance in any particular instance does not mean that we will waive compliance in the
                future. In order for any waiver of compliance with these Terms of Service to be binding, we must provide
                you with written notice of such waiver through one of our authorized representatives.
